#ofxTextureCrop

Simple OF addon to draw an ofTexture within a rect, cropping it appropriately, and hopefully saving on fill Rate.

The red Rectangle shows the cropping bounds defined by the user, the blue rect is the full texture, the green rect is what is drawn in reality (crop) when using this addon.
